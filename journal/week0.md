# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

During the first week of the bootcamp, I went through the prerequisites found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19XMyd5zCk7S9QT2q1_Cg-wvbnBwOge7EgzgvtVCgcz0/edit#heading=h.2kbe0qpj789o). I had 4 of the pre-reqs already setup, so it left me with some extra time.

I created both the Conceptual Diagram and Logical Architectual Diagram via [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)

I had previously been using AWS for work and personal projects, so the AWS CLI, budget, and billing alarm was already setup!
